;;; treesit-config.el --- This file provides configuration for Treesitter -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;;; Commentary:

;; treesit is Emacs' built-in support for tree-sitter. treesit started to be
;; available in Emacs version >29. Before that, you needed to use the tree-sitter
;; ELisp package, which brough the first support of tree-sitter to Emacs.
;;
;; The tree-sitter & tree-sitter-* ELisp packages are a set of 3rd party packages
;; that brought initial support for the tree-sitter incremental parser
;; and all of its supporting libraries (one for each programming
;; language).
;;
;; tree-sitter (the incremental parser) is intended to provide incredibly fast
;; and accurate AST information WITHOUT needing to send the program through a
;; compiler/LSP.
;; Emacs uses tree-sitter for font-locking (highlighting), indentation, and all
;; the other features it used to use regular expressions for when building a
;; major mode. In theory, tree-sitter will produce both more precise and accurate
;; syntax font-locking and indentation.
;;
;; It will take some time for Emacs to move over to tree-sitter (if it ever fully
;; does), so we must remap major modes that previously relied on regular
;; expression parsing to now use the tree-sitter supported mode.

;;; Code:

(require 'personal-functions)

;; Fetch and use the treesit package (which is built INTO Emacs) when Emacs is
;; built with tree-sitter support, which requires Emacs to be >29 AND be
;; configured with:
;; ./configure --with-tree-sitter.
;; We first check the version of Emacs before going on and potentially loading
;; treesit & its changing the major-mode-remap-alist.
