;;; gtags-config.el --- Provides and configures gtags
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Tags allow us to jump through our code to find where things are defined for the first time.
;; This package should be a good start for me, because I can copy Aaron Bieber's config a little.
;;; Code:

(use-package gtags)
(require 'bpr-config)

(provide 'gtags-config)
;;; gtags-config ends here
