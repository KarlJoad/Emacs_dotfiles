;;; treemacs-config.el --- Provides and configures treemacs
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Treemacs provides a way to have a file hierarchy viewer in the Emacs window.
;; This is an interactive viewer, that updates as I do things in the project/directory.
;;; Code:

(use-package treemacs
  :ensure t
  :defer t)

(provide 'treemacs-config)
;;; treemacs-config.el ends here
