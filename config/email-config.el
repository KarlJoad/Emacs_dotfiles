;;; email-config.el --- This file configured mu4e for my email -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Since I tend to use GMail for many things, I have to perform multiple steps
;; to use Emacs to receive, read, compose, and send emails.
;;
;; First, we need an IMAP mail fetching program.
;; For OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, I build my own isync package.
;;   This program contains mbsync as its main binary; project name is isync.
;;   The configuration file for this program is `~/.mbsyncrc'
;;   You need libopenssl-devel and cyrus-sasl-devel packages from OpenSUSE.
;;
;; Next, we need a way to index our mail so we can search through it.
;; mu4e requires another program be installed that interfaces with IMAP
;; to download the emails, since mu ONLY indexes and queries the downloaded
;; emails.
;;
;; To start using `mu' (maildir-utils), you must first download the mail using
;; isync/`mbsync'.
;; Then, you must perform an `mu init --maildir=<path-to-maildir> \
;;                            --my-address="example@domain.com" \
;;                            [--my-address="example2@domain2.com"]`
;; You only need to initialize the mu database once, but you can feed it several
;; personal addresses when initializing.
;; Once done, you must index the database with `mu index'
;;
;; Lastly, we need a way to send the email through SMTP.
;; I will use msmtp to send my mail.
;; It requires there be an `~/.msmtprc' config file.
;; Special permissions are required, namely 600.
