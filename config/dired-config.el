;;; Code:

;; C-x C-j is bound to the (dired-jump) command by default. Put on the more
;; obvious C-x d.
;; We leave the more powerful, but verbose, (dired) command on C-x D
;; It is safe to use keymap-global-set here because these dired commands are set
;; in the global-map.

  :commands (dired dired-jump)
  :bind (("C-x d" . dired-jump)

;; Enable dired-x so that we get the "extra goodies" we want to use in dired.
;; For example, `dired-do-find-marked-files', which does `find-file' on every
;; marked file comes from this library.
