# What is this?
This repository holds all of Karl Hallsby's emacs dotfiles.

# Two Sets of Snippets?
Yes, this is in fact correct.
The snippets provided by yasnippet-snippets are good and plentiful, but aren't applicable for all languages, and there are some special ones that I can use too.
	1. `/elpa/yasnippet-snippets/` - This directory has snippets provided by the yasnippet-snippets package
	2. `/snipepts/` - This directory MOSTLY has snippets from Harry R. Schwartz's emacs dotfile config. https://github.com/hrs/dotfiles/
