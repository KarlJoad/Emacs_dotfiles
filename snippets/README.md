# Why is there `yasnippet-snippets` and a `/snippets/` Directory?
Because, `yasnippet-snippets` doesn't provide all the functionalities that I may need, and more snippets have been made by others.
For example, most of these are drawn from Howard R. Schwarz's snippets on GitHub. (https://github.com/hrs/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs/.emacs.d/snippets/text-mode)
